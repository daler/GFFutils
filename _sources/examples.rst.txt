Examples
--------


Often, GTF/GFF files have non-standard formatting.  While :mod:`gffutils` is
set up to handle standard formatting by default, it also allows great
flexibility for working with non-standard files.  These examples collect
various real-world, difficult-to-work-with files and show how to make them work
with :mod:`gffutils`.  If you have a troublesome file, the best thing to do is
to look at the first few lines for these examples and see if you can find one
with matching formatting.

These example files ship with :mod:`gffutils`.  For interactive use, their
absolute path can be obtained with the :func:`gffutils.example_filename`
function. Each example shows the contents of the file, along with text
explaining the troublesome parts and which settings to use in order to
successfully import into a database and retrieve features.


.. note::

    Be mindful of the difference between the ID attribute of a feature and the
    primary key of that feature in the database.

    :attr:`Feature.id` will always return the primary key.  `Feature["ID"]` will
    return the ID attribute of the feature, if it has one.  In many (but not
    all) cases, `Feature.id == Feature["ID"]`

.. note::

    Also be mindful of the difference between an attribute of a Python object
    vs the 9th field of a GFF line, which is called the "attributes" field
    according to the spec. Confusing?  Yes!

.. _mouse_extra_comma.gff3:

.. rst-class:: html-toggle

mouse_extra_comma.gff3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This file has gene, mRNA, protein, UTR, CDS, and exon annotations. However, not
all of them have a useful ID in their attributes.


File contents
`````````````

.. literalinclude:: ../../gffutils/test/data/mouse_extra_comma.gff3


Import
``````
The defaults for :mod:`gffutils` will load this example into a database.
However, the CDSs do not have ID attributes, and the default for GFF files is
`id_spec="ID"`.  As described at :ref:`id_spec`, they will be accessed by the
names `"CDS_1"`, `"CDS_2"`, and so on.

Note that using `id_spec=["ID", "Name"]` won't work, because the CDSs share the
same Name attribute, `CDS:NC_000083.5:LOC100040603`. We could use
`id_spec=["ID", "Name"]` in combination with `merge_strategy="create_unique"`,
which would give ids like `CDS:NC_000083.5:LOC100040603_1` (with an underscore
an integer at the end for each consecutive occurence of the same ID).  But
we'll go with the simpler default strategy for this file:

>>> import gffutils
>>> fn = gffutils.example_filename('mouse_extra_comma.gff3')
>>> db = gffutils.create_db(fn, ':memory:')

Example access
``````````````
Since the mRNA on line 2 has an ID, we can simply access it by ID:

>>> db['XM_001475631.1']
<Feature mRNA (chr17:6797760-6818159[+]) at 0x...>

It's not very convenient to access the CDSs by their newly created ids
`"CDS_1"`, `"CDS_2"`, etc.  (Which one was "1"?  Is that from the same gene as
CDS "5"?) But we can access those CDSs as children of the mRNA:

>>> [f.id for f in db.children('XM_001475631.1', featuretype='CDS')]
['CDS_1', 'CDS_2', 'CDS_3', 'CDS_4', 'CDS_5']

Or as "grandchildren" of the gene:

>>> [f.id for f in db.children('NC_000083.5:LOC100040603', featuretype='CDS', level=2)]
['CDS_1', 'CDS_2', 'CDS_3', 'CDS_4', 'CDS_5']

Note that the database id values are all unique for the CDSs, but their
`"Name"` attributes are still all the same, as expected:

>>> list(set([f['Name'][0] for f in db.children('XM_001475631.1', featuretype='CDS')]))
['CDS:NC_000083.5:LOC100040603']

c_elegans_WS199_ann_gff.txt

This is a minimal file, with only one feature and that one feature has no
genomic coordinates.  It illustrates how things behave when there is very
little information for a feature.

Import is straightforward:

>>> db = gffutils.create_db(fn, ':memory:')


Access
``````
Confirm there's only a single feature imported:

>>> list(db.all_features())
[<Feature experimental_result_region (I:.-.[+]) at 0x...]

With no obvious ID fields in the attributes, we can access the single feature
by name using the feature type:

>>> db['experimental_result_region_1']
<Feature experimental_result_region (I:.-.[+]) at 0x...>

This shows that the internal representation of null values is None:

>>> f = db['experimental_result_region_1']
>>> assert f.start is None
>>> assert f.stop is None

But the string representation shows "`.`" placeholders:

>>> print(f) #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

.. _c_elegans_WS199_shortened_gff.txt:

c_elegans_WS199_shortened_gff.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This file contains many different kinds of features; much like
:ref:`mouse_extra_comma.gff3` above, some features have IDs, some do not, and
there are many that share the same feature ID.  This example shows a common
way of subsetting features (here, getting all the non-historical CDSs for
a gene).

If `merge_strategy="merge"`, is used here, exceptions will be raised because
all those CDSs cannot be logically merged: they have different
coordinates. So `merge_strategy="create_unique"` is used instead. This kwarg
will add an underscore and an integer to each duplicate value used as a primary
key:

>>> fn = gffutils.example_filename('c_elegans_WS199_shortened_gff.txt')

.. _ensembl_gtf.txt:


ensembl_gtf.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this GTF file, gene_id and transcript_id are identical, creating problems
for unique IDs in the database.


File contents
`````````````

.. literalinclude:: ../../gffutils/test/data/ensembl_gtf.txt

Import
``````
As part of the import process, :mod:`gffutils` creates new "derived" features
for genes and transcripts (see :ref:`gtf`).  These are not explicitly defined in a GTF file, but
can be inferred.  Even though gene and transcript features do not exist in the
file, they will still be created.  This is why `id_spec={'gene': 'gene_id'}`
works: the primary key of "gene" features -- which don't exist in the GTF file
but are inferred by :mod:`gffutils` -- will be the "gene_id" attribute.

Note that in this example, gene_id and transcript_id are identical.  This
causes all sorts of problems.  To get around this we can write a transform
function (see :ref:`transform` for details) that applies an arbitrary
transformation to a dictionary returned by the parser.  This will modify the
data upon import into the database:

>>> def transform_func(x):
...     # adds some text to the end of transcript IDs
...     if 'transcript_id' in x.attributes:
...         x.attributes['transcript_id'][0] += '_transcript'
...     return x


Now we can supply this tranform function to :func:`create_db`:

>>> fn = gffutils.example_filename('ensembl_gtf.txt')
>>> db = gffutils.create_db(fn, ":memory:",
... id_spec={'gene': 'gene_id', 'transcript': "transcript_id"},
... merge_strategy="create_unique",
... transform=transform_func,
... keep_order=True)

Access
``````
We can access the derived "gene" feature by its ID (recall it doesn't actually
exist in the GTF file):

>>> g = db["B0019.1"]
>>> g
<Feature gene (I:12759579-12764949[-]) at 0x...>

>>> print(g)  # doctest:+NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
I	gffutils_derived	gene	12759579	12764949	.	-	.	gene_id "B0019.1";

And the derived "transcript" by its ID -- which now has "_transcript" on the
end because of that transform function:

>>> t = db["B0019.1_transcript"]
>>> t
<Feature transcript (I:12759579-12764949[-]) at 0x...>

>>> print(t)  #doctest:+NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

.. _F3-unique-3.v2.gff:

F3-unique-3.v2.gff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This file does not contain hierarchical information, and has many directives.
Since much of the benefit of :mod:`gffutils` comes from being able to navigate
the hierarchical relationships, it might be overkill to use :mod:`gffutils` on
this file.  An exeception would be if you want to be able to look up the read
names by their ID.  Here, we use yet a differnt way of overriding the way
:mod:`gffutils` decides on a primary key for the database.


File contents
`````````````

.. literalinclude:: ../../gffutils/test/data/F3-unique-3.v2.gff

Import
``````
By default, the `id_spec="some_string"` parameter tells :mod:`gffutils` to
create a primary key based on the value of the "some_string" attribute.  For
this example, however, we would like to make the first field the primary key.
Luckily, :mod:`gffutils` will accept the name of a GFF field, surrounded by
":".  The names of the fields are in `gffutils.constants._gffkeys`:

>>> gffutils.constants._gffkeys
['seqid', 'source', 'featuretype', 'start', 'end', 'score', 'strand', 'frame', 'attributes']

We want to use the first field, `seqid`, as the primary key for the
database, so we use `id_spec=":seqid:"`.

>>> fn = gffutils.example_filename('F3-unique-3.v2.gff')
>>> db = gffutils.create_db(fn, ':memory:', id_spec=[':seqid:'])

>>> db.directives[0]
'solid-gff-version 0.2'

Now we can access the features by their sequence name:

>>> db['3_8_425_F3']
<Feature read (3_8_425_F3:1119124-1119143[-]) at 0x...>


.. _glimmer_nokeyval.gff3:

.. rst-class:: html-toggle

glimmer_nokeyval.gff3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a problematic file in which the attributes are not all in format
"key=val".  This example demonstrates how :mod:`gffutils` handles cases like
this: by implicitly treating them as keys and setting the value to an empty
list.

Like the the :ref:`ensembl_gtf.txt` file, gene and transcript names are not
different.  Based on IDs alone, it's not clear whether the CDS's parent is the
gene or the mRNA.

However, the way to fix this is different from `ensembl_gtf.txt`.  Recall in
that case, we constructed a function to modify transcript IDs, and when
:mod:`gffutils` inferred the new transcripts from the component exons, it used
that new ID.

Here, we need to do several things in the transform function:  if the feature
type contains "RNA", then set the ID to `ID + "_transript"` (this will handle
things like ncRNA, tRNA, etc and is more general than just "mRNA").  Next, we
need to edit the Parent attribute of CDS, exon, etc.  How this is handled will
depend completely on the file you are using.

This shows that keys with missing values are assigned an empty list.  It's up
to the calling code to decide how to handle this (say, by checking for the
presence of the key "Complete".

>>> for k, v in sorted(db['GL0000007'].attributes.items()):
...     print(k, '=', v)
Complete = []
ID = ['GL0000007']
Name = ['GL0000007']

This illustrates that the CDS finds the proper transcript parent.

This file contains a FASTA sequence at the end.  Currently, :mod:`gffutils`

This file is GFF2 format -- the attribute format is like GTF, but without the
required "gene_id" and "transcript_id" fields that are used to infer genes and
transcripts. To get around this, we can supply the `gtf_transcript_key` kwarg,
which will override the default `"transcript_id"` (see :ref:`gtf` for more
background on this).

There is information in the file on which exon goes to which transcript, but no
such information about which CDS goes to which transcript.  There is, however,
information about the parent protein.

File contents
`````````````

.. literalinclude:: ../../gffutils/test/data/jgi_gff2.txt

Import

Inspecting the file, we see that the "name" attribute is repeated on each line.
We can use that as the gene ID for inferring the gene extents, like "gene_id"
in a normal GTF file.  Similarly, the "transcriptId" attribute here can be used
like "transcript_id" in a normal GTF file for inferring transcript extents.

We also need to make a choice about how we're going to use this database.  Do
we want to have the CDS features be considered children of transcripts?  In
that case, we'll need the transform function, which creates a "transcriptId"
attribute out of an existing "proteinId" attribute:

>>> def transform(d):
...     try:
...         d['transcriptId'] = d['proteinId']
...     except KeyError:
...         pass
...     return d

Since we used that transform function, the exons and CDSs are all children of
the "873" transcript:

>>> sorted(list(db.children('873', level=1)), key=lambda x: (x.featuretype, x.start))
[<Feature CDS (chr_1:37061-37174[-]) at 0x...>, <Feature CDS (chr_1:37315-37620[-]) at 0x...>, <Feature CDS (chr_1:37752-38216[-]) at 0x...>, <Feature exon (chr_1:37061-37174[-]) at 0x...>, <Feature exon (chr_1:37315-37620[-]) at 0x...>, <Feature exon (chr_1:37752-38216[-]) at 0x...>]

Here we can see that all children of the gene are accounted for:

>>> for f in db.children("fgenesh1_pg.C_chr_1000007", order_by='featuretype'):
...     print('{0.featuretype:>10}: {0.id}'.format(f))

This file has no gene_id or transcript_id fields; it appears to use "CDS" as
a gene-level kind of object.  So we can use a transform function to add
"gene_id" and "transcript_id" fields to all non-CDS features so that the file
conforms to a GTF standard and gene extents can be inferred.  Furthermore, by
default :mod:`gffutils` uses `'exon'` as the default feature type to merge into
genes.  Here, we need to specify `gtf_subfeature='coding_exon'`. Last, note
that the file itself has inconsistent trailing semicolons. The dialect
detection decides that there should be no trailing semicolon since that's what
the majority of the features use.

We will need `force_dialect_check=True` in this case if we want to be able to have
the parents of the `SAGE_tag` features be recognized, because the attributes
for `SAGE_tag` features are formatted differently.  That is, they don't have
quoted values, and the separating semicolon does not have a space on either
side as is the case for the other features.

The default of `False` means that only the first few lines are checked to
determine the dialect to be used for all lines.  But that won't work here
because of the inconsistent formatting.  So we have to take the more
time-consuming approach of checking every dialect in order to figure out how to
parse them into a dictionary.

... id_spec={'Transcript': "Transcript"},
... force_gff=True,
... force_dialect_check=True,
... keep_order=True)

The dialect for the database will be None:

>>> assert db.dialect is None, db.dialect

For cases like this, we should probably construct our own dialect to force all
attributes to have the same format.  To help with this, we can use the
:func:`helpers.infer_dialect` function by providing attributes:

>>> from gffutils import helpers
>>> dialect = helpers.infer_dialect(
... 'Transcript "B0019.1" ; WormPep "WP:CE40797" ; Note "amx-2" ; Prediction_status "Partially_confirmed" ; Gene "WBGene00000138" ; CDS "B0019.1" ; WormPep "WP:CE40797" ; Note "amx-2" ; Prediction_status "Partially_confirmed" ; Gene "WBGene00000138"',
... )
>>> print(dialect)
{'leading semicolon': False, 'trailing semicolon': False, 'quoted GFF2 values': True, 'field separator': ' ; ', 'keyval separator': ' ', 'multival separator': ',', 'fmt': 'gtf', 'repeated keys': True, 'order': ['Transcript', 'WormPep', 'Note', 'Prediction_status', 'Gene', 'CDS', 'WormPep', 'Note', 'Prediction_status', 'Gene']}

>>> db.dialect = dialect


Access
``````
>>> t = db["B0019.1"]

Since we've set the dialect for the database, any features returned from the
database should follow that dialect:

>>> print(t)  #doctest:+NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
I	Coding_transcript	Transcript	12759582	12764949	.	-	.	Transcript "B0019.1" ; WormPep "WP:CE40797" ; WormPep "WP:CE40797" ; Note "amx-2" ; Note "amx-2" ; Prediction_status "Partially_confirmed" ; Prediction_status "Partially_confirmed" ; Gene "WBGene00000138" ; Gene "WBGene00000138" ; CDS "B0019.1" ; Parent "WBGene00000138" ; Parent "WBGene00000138"

>>> len(list(db.children(t, featuretype='exon')))
15

>>> db['SAGE_tag_1'].attributes['Transcript']
['B0019.1']


>>> len(list(db.children(t, featuretype='SAGE_tag')))
4

.. _gencode-v190.gtf:

gencode-v19.gtf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This example file contains the first gene from the Gencode v19 annotations.
It's in GTF format, but in contrast to an on-spec GTF file, which only has
exon, CDS, UTRs, and start/stop codon features, this file already has genes and
transcripts on separate lines.  This means we can avoid the gene and transcript
inference, which saves time.

.. literalinclude:: ../../gffutils/test/data/gencode-v19.gtf

Import
``````
We can use `disable_infer_genes=True` and `disable_infer_transcripts=True` to
disable the gene and transcript inference.  This will dramatically speed up
import, but will result in identical results:

>>> fn = gffutils.example_filename('gencode-v19.gtf')
>>> db = gffutils.create_db(fn,
... ":memory:",
... keep_order=True,
... disable_infer_genes=True, disable_infer_transcripts=True)



Access
``````
Access is the same as other files:

>>> db['ENSG00000223972.4']
<Feature gene (chr1:11869-14412[+]) at 0x...>


Ensure that inferring gene extent results in the same database -- it just takes
longer to import:

>>> db2 = gffutils.create_db(fn,
... ":memory:",
... keep_order=True,
... disable_infer_genes=True, disable_infer_transcripts=True)

>>> for i, j in zip(db.all_features(), db2.all_features()):
...     assert i == j
